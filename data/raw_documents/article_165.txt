In addition to the reactions originally reported by Johnson , Corey , and Chaykovsky , sulfur ylides have been used for a number of related homologation reactions that tend to be grouped under the same name . With epoxides and aziridines the reaction serves as a ring @-@ expansion to produce the corresponding <unk> or <unk> . The long reaction times required for these reactions prevent them from occurring as significant side reactions when synthesizing epoxides and aziridines . Several cycloadditions wherein the ylide serves as a " nucleophilic carbenoid equivalent " have been reported . Living <unk> using <unk> as the catalyst and ( <unk> ) methanide as the monomer have been reported for the synthesis of various complex polymers .
