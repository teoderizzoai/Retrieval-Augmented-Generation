The most significant point of the treaty was that Porfirio Díaz , and his vice president , Ramón Corral , resign and that de la Barra , acting as interim president organize free elections as soon as possible . Additionally , the treaty stipulated that : An amnesty for all revolutionaries be declared , with the option for some of them to apply for membership in the rurales . The revolutionary forces were to be demobilized as soon as possible and the federal forces were to be the only army in Mexico . This was in order to appease the army , which had opposed a compromise with Madero . Madero and his supporters had the right to name fourteen provisional state governors , and to approve la Barra 's cabinet . Pensions were to be established for relatives of the soldiers who had died fighting the rebels . Policemen and judges , as well as state legislators , that had been appointed or " elected " under Díaz were to retain their offices .
