The most successful reagents employed in a stoichiometric fashion are shown below . The first is a bicyclic <unk> that has been employed in the synthesis of the Î² @-@ adrenergic compound <unk> ( DCI ) but is limited by the availability of only one enantiomer of the reagent . The synthesis of the axial <unk> is rationalized via the 1 @,@ 3 @-@ <unk> effect which reduces the nucleophilicity of the equatorial lone pair . The conformation of the ylide is limited by <unk> strain and approach of the aldehyde is limited to one face of the ylide by steric interactions with the methyl substituents . The other major reagent is a camphor @-@ derived reagent developed by <unk> Aggarwal of the University of Bristol . Both enantiomers are easily synthesized , although the yields are lower than for the <unk> reagent . The ylide conformation is determined by interaction with the bridgehead hydrogens and approach of the aldehyde is blocked by the camphor moiety . The reaction employs a <unk> base to promote formation of the ylide .
