The original publication by Johnson concerned the reaction of 9 @-@ <unk> <unk> with substituted benzaldehyde derivatives . The attempted Wittig @-@ like reaction failed and a <unk> oxide was obtained instead , noting that " Reaction between the sulfur <unk> and <unk> did not afford <unk> as had the phosphorus and arsenic <unk> . " The subsequent development of ( <unk> ) methanide , ( CH3 ) <unk> and ( <unk> ) methanide , ( CH3 ) <unk> ( known as Corey â€“ Chaykovsky reagents ) by Corey and Chaykovsky as efficient methylene @-@ transfer reagents established the reaction as a part of the organic canon .
