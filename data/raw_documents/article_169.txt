The Treaty of Ciudad Juárez was a peace treaty signed between the then President of Mexico , Porfirio Díaz , and the revolutionary Francisco Madero on May 21 , 1911 .

In October 1911 he was elected president , under the banner of the Partido <unk> <unk> , along with José María Pino Suárez , his new running mate as vice @-@ president .
