Many types of ylides can be prepared with various functional groups both on the anionic carbon center and on the sulfur . The substitution pattern can influence the ease of preparation for the reagents ( typically from the sulfonium halide , e.g. <unk> iodide ) and overall reaction rate in various ways . The general format for the reagent is shown on the right . Use of a sulfoxonium allows more facile preparation of the reagent using weaker bases as compared to sulfonium ylides . ( The difference being that a sulfoxonium contains a doubly bonded oxygen whereas the sulfonium does not . ) The former react slower due to their increased stability . In addition , the <unk> by @-@ products of sulfoxonium reagents are greatly preferred to the significantly more toxic , volatile , and odorous <unk> by @-@ products from sulfonium reagents . The vast majority of reagents are <unk> at the ylide carbon ( either R1 or R2 as hydrogen ) . <unk> reagents are much rarer but have been described : If the ylide carbon is substituted with an electron @-@ withdrawing group ( EWG ) , the reagent is referred to as a stabilized ylide . These , similarly to sulfoxonium reagents , react much slower and are typically easier to prepare . These are limited in their usefulness as the reaction can become prohibitively sluggish : examples involving amides are widespread , with many fewer involving esters and virtually no examples involving other EWG 's . For these , the related <unk> reaction is typically more appropriate . If the ylide carbon is substituted with an aryl or allyl group , the reagent is referred to as a semi @-@ stabilized ylide . These have been developed extensively , second only to the classical methylene reagents ( R1 = R2 = H ) . The substitution pattern on aryl reagents can heavily influence the selectivity of the reaction as per the criteria above . If the ylide carbon is substituted with an alkyl group the reagent is referred to as an <unk> ylide . The size of the alkyl groups are the major factors in selectivity with these reagents . The R @-@ groups on the sulfur , though typically <unk> , have been used to synthesize reagents that can perform enantioselective variants of the reaction ( See Variations below ) . The size of the groups can also influence diastereoselectivity in <unk> substrates .
